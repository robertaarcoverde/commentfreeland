=chrome extension that hides user comments on popular brazilian sites=

this is a Google Chrome extension that, when activated, hides the comments sections for popular brazilian news sites. its primary goal is to avoid that I mistakenly read bigotry, hate speeches and general crap that usually pisses me off. besides, I was curious about programming for chrome and its extension points/APIs.

some disclaimers:
- yes, I could have used AdBlock or something like that to achieve the same results. But where's the fun?
- I'm aware of similar extensions for international websites (e.g., ShutUp), and could have reused them as well, but again, where's the fun?
- I could have configured it so that it would be activated by default, but I love clicking the :X icon.
- this is the simplest code I could write to make this work.
